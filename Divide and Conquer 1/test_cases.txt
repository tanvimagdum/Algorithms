Case 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.

Case 2:
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

Case 3:
Input: nums = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no product for single element, hence 0.

Case 4:
Input: nums = [2,0,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: The product for [2,0,4], [2,0] and [0,4] is 0.

Case 5:
Input: nums = [2,2,4]
Output: 16
Explanation: [2,2,4] has the largest product 16.

Case 6:
Input: nums = [-2,-2,4]
Output: 16
Explanation: [-2,-2,4] has the largest product 16. Both negatives cancel out in multiplication.
